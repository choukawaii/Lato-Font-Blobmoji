# Blob Emoji [Blobmoji]
The blob emoji were a divisive feature between 2013 and 2017. Consistent cross-platform emoji interpretation was among the redesign's primary aims. The redesign, which had been in development for about a year, mimicked an Apple effort to include more detail in the emoji glyph and offer yellow skin tone as the default.
